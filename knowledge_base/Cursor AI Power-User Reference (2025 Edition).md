# Cursor AI Power-User Reference (2025 Edition)

## Core Capabilities of Cursor AI

### Architecture \& AI Backbone

Cursor is built on a heavily modified Electron/VSCode fork, not just an extension[1]. This fundamental architecture allows deep AI integration while maintaining familiar VS Code functionality. The editor leverages a mix of purpose-built and frontier models including GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5, Grok, and DeepSeek[2]. Cursor likely employs MoE (Mixture of Experts) architectures similar to Google's GShard systems, selectively activating specialized models based on task requirements[1].

The core AI backbone features custom retrieval models that understand entire codebases[3], enabling context-aware assistance that goes beyond file-level understanding. The system uses intelligent indexing with `.cursorignore` and `.cursorindexingignore` files for precise control over what gets processed[4].

### Supported File Types, Frameworks, Languages

Cursor provides comprehensive multi-language support including:

**Web Development**: JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React, Vue.js, Angular[5][6]
**Backend Development**: Python, Java, C\#, PHP, Ruby, Node.js[5]
**System Programming**: C, C++, Rust[5]
**Mobile Development**: Swift, Kotlin[5]
**Data Science \& ML**: Python, R[5]
**DevOps \& Cloud**: YAML, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes[5]
**Scripting**: Bash, Shell scripting[5]

The editor seamlessly integrates with major frameworks like Next.js, Express, Rails, and Django[6]. VS Code extension compatibility ensures access to the vast VS Code marketplace, though some Microsoft-specific extensions face restrictions[7].

### Primary Use Cases

Cursor excels in several key scenarios:

1. **Rapid Prototyping**: Build functional applications from natural language descriptions[8]
2. **Legacy Code Modernization**: Refactor and update outdated codebases with AI assistance[9]
3. **Multi-file Refactoring**: Coordinate changes across entire project structures[10]
4. **Documentation Generation**: Auto-create comprehensive code documentation[11]
5. **Debugging \& Error Resolution**: AI-powered error detection and fix suggestions[11]
6. **Learning \& Onboarding**: Explain complex code and architectural patterns[11]

## Real-World Usage Scenarios

### Workflow 1 – Full-Stack Application Development

Building complete applications from scratch demonstrates Cursor's comprehensive capabilities. Start by creating a detailed project specification in natural language, then use Agent mode to scaffold the entire application structure[8].

Example: "Create a MERN stack survey platform with user authentication, form builder, response collection, and analytics dashboard." Cursor can generate the complete project structure, implement Firebase auth, create React components with Tailwind styling, and set up the Express backend with MongoDB integration[12].

### Workflow 2 – Legacy Code Modernization

Transform outdated codebases using Cursor's understanding of both old and new patterns. Select multiple legacy files, then use Composer to request comprehensive modernization: "Update this jQuery codebase to React with TypeScript, maintaining all existing functionality while following modern best practices"[9].

The AI analyzes existing patterns, identifies dependencies, and provides step-by-step migration strategies while preserving business logic integrity.

### Workflow 3 – DevOps Pipeline Automation

Generate and maintain CI/CD pipelines across different platforms. Use context from existing infrastructure to create comprehensive deployment workflows[13].

Example prompt: "Generate Azure DevOps YAML pipeline for Node.js app with Docker containerization, automated testing, and deployment to Azure App Service." Cursor creates complete pipeline configurations including proper secret management and rollback strategies[14].

### Workflow 4 – Multi-Repository Monorepo Management

Handle complex monorepo structures using workspace features introduced in v0.50[15]. Cursor can understand dependencies across multiple packages, generate shared utilities, and maintain consistency across different project components within the same workspace.

Set up `.cursor/rules` in each package directory to maintain package-specific coding standards while leveraging global workspace context[16].

### Workflow 5 – Real-time Collaborative Development

Leverage Background Agents for parallel development tasks[15]. While one developer focuses on frontend components, Background Agents can simultaneously work on API endpoints, database migrations, and test suites, all coordinated through Slack integration[17].
