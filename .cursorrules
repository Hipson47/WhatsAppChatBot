rules:
  -  # Enforce f-string
    linter: "flake8"
    code: "F541"
    autoApply: true
    justification: "F-strings are more readable and efficient than other string formatting methods in Python. This rule automatically converts other formats to f-strings."
  -  # Enforce double quotes
    linter: "flake8"
    code: "Q000"
    autoApply: true
    justification: "Using double quotes for strings ensures stylistic consistency across the project, which improves readability. This rule automatically changes single quotes to double quotes."
  -  # Require Google-style docstrings
    linter: "pydocstyle"
    code: "D100,D101,D102,D103,D104,D105,D106,D107"
    autoApply: false # Set to false to avoid AI generating unwanted docstrings; developer adds them manually.
    justification: "Every function, class, and module should have a Google-style docstring to ensure the code is well-documented and easy for other developers to understand."
  -  # Code complexity
    linter: "flake8"
    code: "C901"
    autoApply: false
    justification: "Limiting the cyclomatic complexity of functions helps maintain code that is easier to understand, test, and refactor."
  -  # Line length
    linter: "flake8"
    code: "E501"
    autoApply: false
    justification: "Keeping line length below a set limit (default is 79 for flake8, but often set to 88-120) improves code readability, especially on smaller screens or in split views."
  -  # No unused imports
    linter: "flake8"
    code: "F401"
    autoApply: true
    justification: "Removing unused imports keeps the code clean and prevents unnecessary namespace pollution."
  -  # Trailing commas
    linter: "flake8"
    code: "C812"
    autoApply: true
    justification: "Enforcing trailing commas in multi-line literals (lists, dictionaries) makes version control diffs cleaner and simplifies adding new items."
  -  # Isort for import ordering
    linter: "isort"
    autoApply: true
    justification: "Automatically sorting imports in a standard way (alphabetically, grouped by type) significantly improves code readability and organization."
